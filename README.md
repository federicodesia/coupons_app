<br>The [MVPs & Prototypes](https://dribbble.com/shots/14857079-MVPs-Prototypes) design was made by [PLATFORM](https://dribbble.com/plat4m) in Dribbble.
<br>I tried to replicate it as best as possible to learn about animations.

Thanks to [Danny Lau](https://github.com/kkdlau) for creating the [circular_border_hero](https://github.com/kkdlau/circular_border_hero) package.
<br>I did a temporary deployment basically migrated to null safety.
